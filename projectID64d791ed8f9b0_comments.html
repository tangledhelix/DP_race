<HTML><BODY><pre><code>Evaluated after PP reclaim. The material is based on a reprint
from a periodical. The UPenn images have a typed front-page
which appears to replace a missing pamphlet cover. TIA have
a scan set from the LOC which includes the pamphlet cover and
text on verso. A missing page project will be required.

An overlay comparison confirms that the body of the text is
the same in the two printings (the LOC has a signature mark
that UPenn do not, but we discard those, so that does not matter).

Needs new clearance based on new TP&amp;V.

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This is a 1915 book by anthropologist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Boas">Franz Boas</a> (1858-1942) covering race and nationality in the context of World War I.  He states that people saw it as "an unavoidable war of races" and proceeds to criticize this view as otherwise the "so-called 'racial instinct' would perpetuate wars of extermination until one race alone survived".  It is a short but pointed pamphlet that had a timely relevance.</p>
