#### Description

This is a 1915 book by anthropologist [Franz Boas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Boas) (1858-1942) covering race and nationality in the context of World War I.  He states that people saw it as "an unavoidable war of races" and proceeds to criticize this view as otherwise the "so-called 'racial instinct' would perpetuate wars of extermination until one race alone survived".  It is a short but pointed pamphlet that had a timely relevance.
