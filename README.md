### Things to revisit ###

* [x] From PM notes: The initial "race and nationality" on page 3 will be a chapter heading and all the rest will be section headings.
* [x] p. 3: drawn borders on title page
* [x] (HTML) verify viewport tag addition didn't cause a problem.
    * It not only caused no problem, its presence is a significant improvement.

### Project manager notes ###

#### Description

This is a 1915 book by anthropologist [Franz Boas](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franz_Boas) (1858-1942) covering race and nationality in the context of World War I.  He states that people saw it as "an unavoidable war of races" and proceeds to criticize this view as otherwise the "so-called 'racial instinct' would perpetuate wars of extermination until one race alone survived".  It is a short but pointed pamphlet that had a timely relevance.
